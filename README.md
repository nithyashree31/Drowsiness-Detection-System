Driver drowsiness detection is a project built using Dlib and OpenCV with Python as a backend language.
With this Python project, we will be making a drowsiness detection system. A countless number of people drive on the highway day and night. 
Taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers and people traveling long-distance suffer from lack of sleep. Due to which it becomes very dangerous to drive when feeling sleepy. 
The majority of accidents happen due to the drowsiness of the driver. 
So, to prevent these accidents we will build a system using Python, OpenCV, and Keras which will alert the driver when he feels sleepy. 
Drowsiness detection is a safety technology that can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving. 
The objective of this Python project is to build a drowsiness detection system that will detect that a person’s eyes are closed for a few seconds. 
This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected. In this Python project, we will be using OpenCV for gathering the images from webcam and feed them into a Deep Learning model which will classify whether the person’s eyes are ‘Open’ or ‘Closed’.
